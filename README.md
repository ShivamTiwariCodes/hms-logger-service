# HMS Logger Service

**HMS Logger Service** is a lightweight JavaScript microservice responsible for centralized logging within the **Hospital Management System (HMS)**. It collects, processes, and stores logs generated by other HMS services, enabling efficient monitoring and debugging.

---

## 📦 Features

* Centralized log collection via HTTP or messaging queues
* Support for various log levels (info, warn, error, debug)
* Structured JSON logging for easy parsing
* Integration-friendly design for other HMS microservices
* Configurable log storage and rotation (file, DB, or external system)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the HMS Logger Service locally.

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Node.js v14 or higher
* npm v6 or higher
* Access to storage backend (e.g., filesystem, MongoDB, or other)

---

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/hms-logger-service.git
   cd hms-logger-service
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update the `.env` with your logging backend configuration, log level, and any other parameters.

4. **Start the service**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
